Send an email to this address and the inbox will receive and store it for you.

To retrieve the email use the Inbox and Email Controller endpoints with the inbox ID.

To get emails in an inbox use the WaitFor and Inbox Controller methods `waitForLatestEmail` and `getEmails` methods respectively. Inboxes can be used with aliases to forward emails automatically.
