Send an email to this address and the inbox will receive and store it for you.

To retrieve the email use the Inbox and Email Controller endpoints with the inbox ID.

  // ID of the inbox. The ID is a UUID-V4 format string. Use the inboxId for calls to Inbox and Email Controller endpoints. See the emailAddress property for the email address or the inbox. To get emails in an inbox use the WaitFor and Inbox Controller methods `waitForLatestEmail` and `getEmails` methods respectively. Inboxes can be used with aliases to forward emails automatically.

  // Type of inbox - either HTTP (default) or SMTP. HTTP inboxes are great most cases. SMTP inboxes are receive only (cannot send) and are processed by a custom SMTP mail server and are better for public facing inboxes that receive emails from Gmail and other large providers. If using a custom domain the domain type must match the inbox type. Use an SMTP domain for SMTP inboxes that includes an MX record pointing to `10 mx.mailslurp.com` for inbound messages.
